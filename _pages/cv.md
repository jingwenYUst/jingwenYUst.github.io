Trials of the Autonomous Logistic Vehicle (Hercules: 夸父)
======
Sep. 2021 – Aug. 2023 (HKUST)

This project aims at deploying an autonomous logistic vehicle (please check IEEE RAM paper) in HKUST to deliver food and goods between restaurants and offices. My role in this project is to conduct a series of tests on the campus to demonstrate that the autonomous vehicle (Hercules) is safe, reliable, and intelligent.

UGV-Quadrupedal Robot Autonomous Delivery
======
Sep. 2021 – Aug. 2022 (HKUST)

(Core Participator) This project aims at deploying a quadrupedal robot for indoor “last mile” delivery in col- laboration with an autonomous logistic vehicle on the HKUST campus. I implemented an indoor LIDAR-inertial localization system on a quadrupedal robot (Unitree A1). Real-world experiments have been conducted in the Cheng Yu Tung Building (CYT) and Robotics Institute (RI) of HKUST.
